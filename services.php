The tests have been designed in a very user-friendly interface.<br><br> The final level of the process is the interview, wherein the candidate personally gets interviewed by the company recruiters. Our website which is currently unrealistic, can be implemented in reality by the institutions and universities, and it sounds to be of great potential as the whole process is user-friendly, convenient and transparent.<br></p>
